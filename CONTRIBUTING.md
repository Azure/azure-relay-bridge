# Contributing

This project welcomes contributions and suggestions. Most contributions require
you to agree to a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) declaring that you have
the right to, and actually do, grant us the rights to use your contribution. For
details, visit https://cla.microsoft.com.

When you submit a pull request, a CLA-bot will automatically determine whether
you need to provide a CLA and decorate the PR appropriately (e.g., label,
comment). Simply follow the instructions provided by the bot. You will only need
to do this once across all repositories using our CLA.

To open your own pull request, click
[here](https://github.com/clemensv/azure-relay-bridge/compare). When creating a
pull request, keep the following in mind:
- Make sure you are pointing to the fork and branch that your changes were made
  in
- The pull request template that is provided **should be filled out**; this is
  not something that should just be deleted or ignored when the pull request is
  created
    - Deleting or ignoring this template will elongate the time it takes for
      your pull request to be reviewed

opened.

- Title of the pull request is clear and informative
- There are a small number of commits that each have an informative message
- A description of the changes the pull request makes is included, and a
  reference to the bug/issue the pull request fixes is included, if applicable
