# Azure Relay Bridge Configuration

# Specifies which address family to use when connecting.  Valid
# arguments are "any", "inet" (use IPv4 only), or "inet6"
# (use IPv6 only).  The default is "any".

AddressFamily :

# Azure Relay connection string for a Relay namespace. Only one 
# namespace connection string can be specified per configuration
# file.

AzureRelayConnectionString :

# Azure Relay endpoint URI for a Relay namespace. Overrides 
# the 'Endpoint' property of the connection string, if present.

AzureRelayEndpoint :

#  Azure Relay shared access policy name. Overrides the 'SharedAccessKeyName' 
# property of the connection string, if present.

AzureRelaySharedAccessKeyName :

# Azure Relay shared access policy key. Overrides the 'SharedAccessKey' 
# property of the connection string, if present.

AzureRelaySharedAccessKey :

# Azure Relay shared access policy signature. Overrides the 'SharedAccessSignature' 
# property of the connection string, if present.

AzureRelaySharedAccessSignature :

# Use the specified address on the local machine as the source
# address of the connection.  Only useful on systems with more than
# one address.  

BindAddress :

# Specifies that all local, and remote port forwardings
# specified in the configuration files or on the command line be
# cleared.  This option is primarily useful when used from the
# command line to clear port forwardings set in configura-
# tion files. The argument must be "true" or "false".  The default is "false".

ClearAllForwardings :

#  Specifies the number of tries (one per second) to make
#  before exiting.  The argument must be an integer.  This may be useful in scripts
#  if the connection sometimes fails.  The default is 1.

ConnectionAttempts :

#  Specifies the timeout (in seconds) used when connecting to the
#  relay server, instead of using the default system TCP timeout.
#  This value is used only when the target is down or really
#  unreachable, not when it refuses the connection.

ConnectTimeout :

#  Specifies whether azbridge(1) should terminate the 
#  connection if it  cannot set up all requested local, and remote port forwardings, 
#  (e.g. if either end is unable to bind and listen on a specified port). 
#  The argument must be "true" or "false". The default is "false".

ExitOnForwardFailure :

#  Specifies whether remote hosts are allowed to connect to local
#  forwarded ports.  By default, azbridge(1) binds local port forwardings
#  to the loopback address.  This prevents other remote hosts from
#  connecting to forwarded ports.  GatewayPorts can be used to specify that azbridge 
#  should bind local port forwardings to the wildcard address, thus allowing remote 
#  hosts to connect to forwarded ports. The argument must be "true" or "false".  
#  The default is "false". 

GatewayPorts :

#  Specifies that a (set of) TCP ports on the local machine 
#  shall be forwarded via the Azure Relay. Each entry can have four properties,
#  "BindAddress", "BindPort", "LocalSocket", and "RelayName". 

LocalForward :
#   - BindAddress: 127.0.8.1
#     BindPort: 443
#     RelayName: a1

#  Gives the verbosity level that is used when logging messages 
#  from azbridge(1). The possible values are : QUIET, FATAL, ERROR, INFO, VERBOSE, 
#  DEBUG, DEBUG1, DEBUG2, and DEBUG3.  The default is INFO.
#  DEBUG and DEBUG1 are equivalent.  DEBUG2 and DEBUG3 each specify
#  higher levels of verbose output.

LogLevel : ERROR

# Specifies that a TCP port on the remote machine be bound to 
# a name on the Azure Relay. Each entry can have four properties, "RelayName", "Host", 
# "HostPort", and "LocalSocket". 

RemoteForward :
#   - RelayName: a1
#     Host: localhost
#     HostPort: 443
